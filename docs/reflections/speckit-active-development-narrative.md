# Speckit Active Development Narrative

## Background: Breaking the Project-to-Project Pinball
After years of jumping between initiatives, I’m committing to Speckit so every effort lands on a consistent, auditable spec foundation instead of fragmenting across repos and ad hoc prompts.

## How Speckit Anchors Consistency
Speckit’s repo-aware CLI and TUI keep the spec-edit → diff → commit loop inside the terminal, which means the work I finish stays traceable and ready for review without leaving the developer workflow.

Because every project shares the same spec bundle, it becomes far easier to maintain a single source of truth across teams and iterations instead of rebuilding context from scratch.

## Platform-Native Templates to Stop Regressions
Rather than chasing platform-agnostic scaffolds, I’m leaning on Speckit’s official templates—especially the Next.js + Supabase starter—and extending them with repo-local variants so domain-specific guardrails (like the right RLS patterns) ship by default and never drift as new agents join the effort.

## Reinforcing Agent Reliability
Structured specs give coding agents the full historical context they’ve been missing; that keeps later prompts from undoing earlier architectural choices and aligns with Speckit’s goal of feeding automation richer, versioned requirements instead of one-off instructions.

## Roadmap Alignment and Next Steps
This focus dovetails with Speckit’s near-term plan to expand template coverage, polish the TUI commit flow, and introduce planning/task breakdowns, while also teeing up the longer journey toward a managed Next.js + Supabase SaaS that mirrors the CLI/TUI contract.

## Action Items
- Migrate prior projects into Speckit workspaces so governance artifacts—RTM, ADRs, and PR templates—can enforce the audit trail I’ve been missing.
- Harden platform-specific templates with best-practice defaults (e.g., secure RLS statements) so collaborators and agents inherit the correct posture automatically.
- Prepare for future SaaS orchestration by keeping templates and agent expectations aligned with the long-term product direction.

## Alignment Highlights
- The emphasis on spec consistency directly addresses the repo’s stated risks of drift, inconsistency, and agent underperformance when specs stay scattered.
- Building opinionated templates for stacks like Next.js + Supabase supports the differentiator of a governed template registry and sets up the roadmap’s expansion into more stacks and SaaS orchestration.
