# Reflection: Strengthening Spec Consistency with SpecKit

## Refined Narrative
1. **Recommitting to disciplined specs.** I have bounced from project to project without a stable specification workflow, which made delivery inconsistent. Active development on SpecKit is my way to anchor that work: every backlog item now routes through a shared, versioned spec loop so unfinished initiatives can be revisited and completed with traceability.
2. **Maintaining and auditing multi-project work.** By consolidating specs inside the repo, I can keep codebases maintainable and auditable across all projects. The same workflow will also stabilize coding-agent output, because agents will reference living specs instead of ad hoc prompts.
3. **Baking in platform-specific wisdom.** Platform-agnostic spec tools often miss the nuanced integration details that matter for performance, scalability, and security. SpecKit templates can encode those lessons—e.g., the Next.js + Supabase template should default Row Level Security policies to `SELECT` statements—so guardrails ship out of the box and prevent regressions as more agents and humans contribute.
4. **Guarding against agent regressions.** Iterating on complex systems with only prompt-crafted guidance causes coding agents to undo earlier architectural decisions. SpecKit’s spec-first approach gives agents stable historical context, avoiding the circular builds that appear once prompts drift from prior agreements.

## Alignment with the Problem & Vision Statement
- **Spec drift and inconsistency.** The reflection underscores the same pain points called out in the Problem Statement—scattered specs, drift, and inconsistent structures—and validates the repo’s focus on a spec-first toolchain to keep agents productive.
- **Templates as differentiators.** The emphasis on platform-informed templates aligns with the Vision’s call for template-driven onboarding and highlights how the official Next.js + Supabase path can embody real-world integration guidance rather than staying generic.
- **Full-context AI assistance.** Capturing iteration history inside the repo reinforces the Vision’s promise of AI proposals that respect prior constraints, helping avoid the regressions I have repeatedly experienced when agents only consider the latest prompt.

## Roadmap and Repo Implications
- **Template hardening.** Expand template coverage (starting with Next.js + Supabase) to encode performance and security defaults such as RLS policy patterns, ensuring future contributors inherit opinionated best practices instead of reinventing them.
- **Agent context plumbing.** Prioritize roadmap work that lets the SpecKit agent consume prior spec revisions or requirement traces so iterative prompts stay anchored to the project’s signed-off architecture.
- **Backlog triage via SpecKit.** Re-open past projects under a SpecKit-managed workflow, using the TUI/CLI loop to document remaining scope, drive them to completion, and keep evidence auditable.

## Immediate Next Steps
- Catalog the projects that need to be realigned under SpecKit and author baseline specs for each.
- Update the Next.js + Supabase template to codify the RLS `SELECT` guidance and other environment-specific guardrails.
- Exercise the agent workflow against a multi-iteration feature to validate that regression risk drops when the full spec archive is supplied.
