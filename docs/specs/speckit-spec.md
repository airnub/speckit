## Why it matters

- **One source of truth at any scale** — keep distributed teams anchored to the same curated spec library so every change request starts from shared context and audit logs stay tidy.
- **Stack-flexible planning** — if you pivot frameworks or hosting platforms, you adjust the delivery path instead of rewriting requirements; the spec articulates outcomes, not implementation trivia.
- **Requirements tracked like code** — housing specs beside your repo history means reviews, diffs, and approvals flow through the same pipelines as application code, locking in provenance.
- **Full-context AI assistance** — when you invite the agent, it consumes the entire spec, recent edits, and linked artifacts, producing guidance grounded in the story the team already vetted.
