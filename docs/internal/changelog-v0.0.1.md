# Changelog (v0.0.1)

## Added
- Initial internal baseline covering: CLI/TUI/Core/Agent (stub), template registry, runners (K/B), settings, and AI gating.
- ADRs 0001 (monorepo+Ink) and 0002 (AI optional + lazy imports).
- RTM linking functional requirements to design, code, and tests.

## Notes
- Orchestration plan is tracked as `docs/internal/orchestration-plan-v0.0.2.md` and your **root `AGENTS.md`** is maintained manually.
