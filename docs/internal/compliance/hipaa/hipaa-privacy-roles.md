# Privacy Governance and Role Alignment

The HIPAA Privacy Rule relies on a clearly defined governance model so that disclosures of protected health information (PHI) follow the minimum necessary principle. This guide aligns core roles with HIPAA Security Rule safeguards and their mapped NIST SP 800-53 Rev.5 controls.

## Core roles

- **HIPAA Privacy Officer** – Oversees policies for minimum necessary use and disclosure, coordinates with the Security Officer on Administrative safeguards (45 CFR §164.308).
- **HIPAA Security Officer** – Owns technical and physical safeguards (45 CFR §164.310 and 45 CFR §164.312), ensuring operational controls align with NIST SP 800-66 guidance.
- **Workforce Managers** – Enforce workforce security onboarding/termination (45 CFR §164.308 §164.308(a)(3)) and verify unique user IDs are revoked promptly (mapped to AC-2, IA-2, IA-4).
- **Incident Response Coordinator** – Leads breach notification decision making, using audit trail outputs from Audit Controls and mapped controls AU-2, AU-6, AU-12.

## Minimum necessary workflow

1. Document routine disclosures and justify them against job functions.
2. For non-routine disclosures, require Security Officer review and log the decision.
3. Automate identity and access management to enforce least privilege (mapped to AC-2, IA-2, IA-4).
4. Retain disclosure logs with the same retention as audit controls to enable breach impact analysis.

## Collaboration checklist

- Privacy and Security Officers review the HIPAA checklist quarterly, focusing on safeguards flagged as MANUAL.
- Workforce managers receive revocation reports derived from unique user ID provisioning systems.
- Incident response playbooks cite the OLIR HIPAA ↔︎ 800-53 mapping to connect safeguards with organisational controls.
