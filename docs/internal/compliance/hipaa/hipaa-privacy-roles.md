# HIPAA Privacy Roles

Secure mode assumes HIPAA applies to the following organization types:

- Covered Entity
- Business Associate


The minimum necessary standard should be enforced across data disclosures and workforce access provisioning.

## Role to Safeguard Mapping

| Role | Primary Safeguards | Notes |
| ---- | ------------------ | ----- |
| Security & Privacy Officer | §164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A); NIST RA-3, RA-5 | Owns recurring risk analysis and tracks mitigation progress. |
| People Operations / HR | §164.308(a)(3)(ii)(B); NIST PS-3, AC-2 | Validates workforce clearances and revokes stale access. |


## Disclosure Decision Flow

1. **Assess Purpose** — confirm the disclosure aligns with treatment, payment, operations, or a documented exception.
2. **Limit the Dataset** — release only the data required to satisfy the request.
3. **Log the Disclosure** — capture who requested, what was released, and the lawful basis.
4. **Review Quarterly** — reconcile disclosures against the risk analysis and workforce clearance procedures.
