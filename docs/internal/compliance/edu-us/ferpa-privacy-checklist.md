# FERPA Privacy Checklist

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) protects the privacy of student education records for institutions that receive funds from the U.S. Department of Education. Use this checklist to document how your product meets FERPA requirements across disclosures, directory information, and access rights.

## 1. Disclosures of Education Records
- [ ] Maintain a master inventory of education records collected, processed, or stored.
- [ ] Document lawful bases for each disclosure permitted under 34 CFR Part 99 (e.g., school officials with legitimate educational interests, health and safety emergencies, subpoenas).
- [ ] Record disclosures and requests for access in an auditable log available to parents and eligible students.
- [ ] Verify that downstream processors contractually restrict redisclosure and protect student information.

## 2. Directory Information Management
- [ ] Publish a current directory information policy describing the data elements designated as directory information.
- [ ] Provide annual notice to parents and eligible students that explains their right to opt out of directory information sharing.
- [ ] Track opt-out preferences and ensure suppression in all exports, dashboards, public websites, and APIs.
- [ ] Review data releases for marketing or third-party analytics to confirm directory information is not misused.

## 3. Access and Amendment Rights
- [ ] Provide a documented process for parents and eligible students to request inspection of education records within 45 days.
- [ ] Authenticate requesters before granting access, and offer secure delivery methods for digital records.
- [ ] Maintain a correction workflow for disputing inaccurate or misleading information, including hearings when necessary.
- [ ] Communicate outcomes of access or amendment requests and maintain records of each request.
