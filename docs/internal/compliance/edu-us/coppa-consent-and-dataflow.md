# COPPA Consent & Data Flow Workbook

The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requires verifiable parental consent and transparent handling of personal information for children under 13. Capture the workflow and controls for applications that collect data from child users or students using school-authorized online services.

## 1. Scope & Data Inventory
- [ ] Identify online services directed to children under 13 or used in a school context where districts act as the agent for parental consent.
- [ ] Inventory personal information collected (e.g., persistent identifiers, geolocation, photos, audio, video) and map each element to a lawful purpose.
- [ ] Document data sharing with processors, analytics providers, or ad-tech, including retention windows and deletion triggers.

## 2. Notices & Consent Records
- [ ] Provide direct notices to parents describing categories of information collected, intended uses, and the ability to refuse or revoke consent.
- [ ] Maintain verifiable parental consent records that describe the method used (e.g., signed form, credit card verification, video call) and the date received.
- [ ] Support school districts acting as intermediaries by documenting agreements that cover consent scope, operator responsibilities, and data access rights.

## 3. Data Retention & Deletion
- [ ] Define retention limits tied to the educational purpose and automatically purge personal information when no longer needed.
- [ ] Implement deletion SLAs for parental or district requests (recommended: within 30 days) and log completion.
- [ ] Validate that personal information is not used for behavioral advertising or profiling unrelated to the educational experience.
