# California SOPIPA Overlay

The Student Online Personal Information Protection Act (SOPIPA), Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 22584–22585, restricts the use of K–12 student data by operators of online services.

## Key Guardrails
- [ ] Prohibit targeted advertising to students or on the basis of student profile information obtained through the service.
- [ ] Ban building a profile about a K–12 student unless it is strictly used for K–12 school purposes.
- [ ] Disallow the sale of student personal information.
- [ ] Support deletion requests from schools or districts when information is no longer required for the stated educational purpose.
