- Provide a way to request translations or accessible formats.

## Data privacy and security policy

- Post the district-wide Data Privacy and Security Policy that aligns with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.
- Document how the policy is reviewed annually and approved by the board of education.
- Share how vendors must comply with Part 121 and Education Law 2-d obligations.

## Data Protection Officer (DPO)

- Identify the appointed DPO and publish contact information for incident response and parental inquiries.
- Maintain training records demonstrating the DPO and staff understand FERPA, NYSED guidance, and breach notification rules.
- Provide escalation paths for third-party vendors to contact the DPO when incidents occur.

## Third-party contracts and supplemental information
