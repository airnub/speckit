# CIPA Filtering and Monitoring Guardrails

The Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) sets conditions for schools and libraries that receive E-Rate discounts. Use this outline to confirm your security program documents the required filtering and monitoring practices.

## Technology protection measures

- Maintain an inventory of web filtering solutions that block access to obscene or harmful visual content as defined in 47 U.S.C. ยง254(h).
- Describe how the filters are applied across managed devices, guest networks, and any cloud applications students access.
- Document the exception approval process when instructional staff need temporary access to blocked resources.

## Monitoring and safety policies

- Publish an Internet safety policy covering monitoring practices, social media use, and student education on appropriate online behavior (47 CFR ยง54.520).
- Retain meeting minutes or board approvals that show the policy was adopted after reasonable public notice and hearing.
- Record how monitoring alerts are triaged, escalated, and closed to demonstrate oversight.

## E-Rate eligibility attestations

- Keep annual certifications that the district enforces its filtering and monitoring policies as a condition of E-Rate funding.
- Track any outages or filter bypass events and the remediation steps taken.
- Ensure procurement packages reference CIPA requirements when acquiring new filtering or monitoring tools.
