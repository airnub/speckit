- [ ] Document public notice and hearing records demonstrating community input before adopting or revising the policy.
- [ ] Track policy review cadence (at least annually) and responsible roles for approvals.

## 2. Technology Protection Measures
- [ ] Deploy filtering technology that blocks or filters obscene images, child pornography, and material harmful to minors across all devices accessing the network.
- [ ] Maintain change management records for filter rules, categories, and exception handling.
- [ ] Ensure filtering extends to off-premises devices using school-managed networks or VPNs.

## 3. Monitoring & Education
- [ ] Document active monitoring procedures for student online activity while on school devices or networks.
- [ ] Provide ongoing digital citizenship and online safety education for students, including training records and curriculum references.
