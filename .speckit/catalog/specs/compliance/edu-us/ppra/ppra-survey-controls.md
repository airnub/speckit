# PPRA Survey Controls and Parental Rights

The Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA) limits how schools conduct surveys or collect information on sensitive topics. Use this checklist to show how your program protects student privacy and honors parental rights.

## Sensitive survey approvals

- Catalog all surveys that ask about political affiliations, mental health, sexual behavior, religious practices, or family income (20 U.S.C. §1232h).
- Obtain school board approval and document the review criteria for each survey instrument.
- Retain copies of survey instruments and evidence that parents were notified before administration.

## Parental review and opt-out rights

- Publish a policy describing how parents can inspect instructional materials, including third-party surveys or assessments.
- Provide an opt-out form for non-emergency physical exams, personal surveys, or marketing-related data collection.
- Track opt-out responses and ensure downstream systems suppress data collection for those students.

## Data minimization and sharing safeguards

- Limit survey data access to authorized staff and aggregate results when reporting to external stakeholders.
- Document contracts or data-sharing agreements with third parties that analyze survey data.
- Define retention and destruction timelines for survey responses, including backups and analytics exports.
