# PPRA Survey Controls

The Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA) governs surveys, analyses, and evaluations funded by the U.S. Department of Education or administered by schools receiving federal funds. Use this worksheet to capture parental rights and data handling controls for sensitive survey content.

## 1. Sensitive Content Inventory
- [ ] Identify surveys or research instruments that cover PPRA’s eight protected information categories (political affiliations, mental or psychological problems, sex behavior or attitudes, illegal behavior, critical appraisals of family, legally recognized privileged relationships, religious practices, income).
- [ ] Document purposes and funding sources for each survey to confirm whether PPRA applies.
- [ ] Maintain content reviews to ensure questions align with approved purpose and minimize data collection.

## 2. Parental Notification & Opt-Outs
- [ ] Provide prior notice to parents and eligible students with survey details, administration dates, and opt-out procedures.
- [ ] Track opt-in consent when required (e.g., surveys funded by the U.S. Department of Education) and maintain records of responses.
- [ ] Offer alternative activities for students who opt out and record participation.

## 3. Data Access & Retention
- [ ] Restrict access to survey responses to authorized researchers or school officials with legitimate educational interests.
- [ ] Establish retention schedules and destruction methods appropriate for sensitive survey data.
- [ ] Communicate de-identification and aggregation practices before sharing results externally.
