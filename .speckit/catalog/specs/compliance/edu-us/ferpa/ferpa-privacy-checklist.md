# FERPA Privacy Checklist

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) protects student education records and governs how schools disclose, access, and safeguard student information. Use this checklist to confirm the core privacy controls are documented when you assemble a U.S. education compliance package.

## Disclosure controls

- Maintain a written policy that describes how the district or operator authorizes disclosures without consent under 34 CFR §99.31.
- Log all disclosures internally so parents and eligible students can review who accessed their records.
- Train staff on minimum necessary disclosures and annual FERPA awareness expectations.

## Directory information boundaries

- Publish the fields that are considered "directory information" and explain how families can opt out (34 CFR §99.37).
- Document the review cadence for directory information designations and the communication process for opt-out deadlines.
- Ensure any student directory exports are scoped to the published fields and remove suppressed entries.

## Access and amendment rights

- Provide a documented request process that lets parents or eligible students inspect and review education records within 45 days.
- Describe how amendment requests are handled, including hearing procedures when the school refuses to amend records (34 CFR §§99.20–99.22).
- Track fulfillment timelines to prove the district meets FERPA's response windows.
