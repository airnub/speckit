# COPPA Consent and Data Flow Checklist

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requires verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from children under 13. This checklist highlights the operational guardrails education products must document.

## Verifiable parental consent

- Capture the consent mechanism used (e.g., signed form, ID verification, payment credential) and store timestamps for audit readiness.
- Provide a workflow for revoking consent and removing associated child data.
- Maintain consent evidence for as long as the child's account is active plus the retention period documented below.

## Direct notices and privacy disclosures

- Publish a child-directed privacy notice explaining the categories of data collected, operators involved, and how parents can contact the service (16 CFR ยง312.4).
- Send direct notice to parents before collecting information from a child, referencing the specific activities that require data.
- Track which disclosures have been delivered and confirm that records exist for each child's parent or guardian.

## Data retention and deletion limits

- Document the maximum retention period for child data and ensure systems automatically purge records when no longer needed (16 CFR ยง312.10).
- Verify backups, analytics exports, and support systems follow the same retention clock.
- Provide a workflow to respond to parental deletion requests within a reasonable timeframe.
