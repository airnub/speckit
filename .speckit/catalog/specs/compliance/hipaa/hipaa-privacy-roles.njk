# HIPAA Privacy Roles

Secure mode assumes HIPAA applies to the following organization types:

{% for audience in hipaa.scope %}- {{ audience | replace("-", " ") | title }}
{% endfor %}

The minimum necessary standard should be enforced across data disclosures and workforce access provisioning.

## Role to Safeguard Mapping

| Role | Primary Safeguards | Notes |
| ---- | ------------------ | ----- |
{% for safeguard in hipaa.admin_safeguards %}| {{ safeguard.role }} | {{ safeguard.references }} | {{ safeguard.notes }} |
{% endfor %}

## Disclosure Decision Flow

1. **Assess Purpose** — confirm the disclosure aligns with treatment, payment, operations, or a documented exception.
2. **Limit the Dataset** — release only the data required to satisfy the request.
3. **Log the Disclosure** — capture who requested, what was released, and the lawful basis.
4. **Review Quarterly** — reconcile disclosures against the risk analysis and workforce clearance procedures.
