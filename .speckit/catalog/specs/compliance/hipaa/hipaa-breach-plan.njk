# HIPAA Breach Response Plan

Use this decision tree to triage incidents that may trigger the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule. Technical safeguards such as
{{ hipaa.technical_refs | join(", ") }} reduce likelihood, but an executable plan is still required.

## Incident Response Checklist

1. **Assemble the team** — security lead, privacy officer, legal, and communications.
2. **Preserve evidence** — capture system images and relevant audit logs.
3. **Determine containment** — isolate affected systems and revoke compromised credentials.
4. **Risk assessment** — evaluate nature of ePHI, unauthorized individuals involved, and mitigation success.
5. **Notification drafting** — align with HIPAA content requirements and regional regulations.
6. **Post-incident review** — feed corrective actions into the risk analysis and workforce training plans.
