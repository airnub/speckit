# Orchestration Plan — {{ spec.meta.title }} (v{{ spec.meta.version }})

## Launch Sequence
1. `pnpm install` to hydrate workspace dependencies.
2. `pnpm -w speckit gen --bundle nextjs-supabase` to materialize docs.
3. `pnpm lint` and `pnpm test` to confirm baseline quality gates.
4. Schedule stakeholder review with generated spec links.

## Working Agreements
- Keep `docs/internal/**` as the editable workspace for product + engineering.
- Treat `.speckit/catalog/**` as immutable; changes require maintainer approval.
- Document architecture choices via ADRs under `docs/internal/adr/`.

## Milestones
### M1 — Catalog setup
- Ensure bundle manifest references outputs under `docs/specs/`.
- Verify CODEOWNERS and CI guard rails are enabled.

### M2 — Feature delivery
- Implement Next.js routes for backlog, runbook, and changelog views.
- Connect Supabase policies to enforce row-level security.
- Instrument usage analytics (feature flags optional).

### M3 — Handoff
- Capture release notes in generated changelog output.
- Run `speckit verify` prior to merge to catch drift.
- Archive decision logs and link to release PR.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Catalog edits bypass process** → Block PRs without `catalog:allowed` label.
- **Spec drift** → Enforce `speckit verify` in CI and require clean diffs.
- **Runtime churn** → Pin pnpm workspace versions and document upgrade steps.
