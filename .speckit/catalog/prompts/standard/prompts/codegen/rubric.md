A high-quality response must:

- Demonstrate awareness of the latest internal brief, spec, plan, RTM, and relevant ADRs.
- Propose a safe, incremental implementation plan scoped to the requested task.
- Provide accurate unified diffs covering only the necessary files.
- Include validation steps (commands or scripts) that reflect the change surface.
- Summarize residual risks or follow-up actions.

Submissions that ignore repository conventions, omit diffs, or skip verification guidance should be rejected.
