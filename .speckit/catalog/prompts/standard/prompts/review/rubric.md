A review response should:

- Verify alignment with the spec, orchestration plan, RTM, and ADRs.
- Inspect the diff for logical, architectural, and style issues.
- Confirm appropriate tests and documentation updates.
- Offer actionable remediation guidance when requesting changes.
- Finish with a clear approval state.

Reviews that rubber-stamp changes without analysis or omit blocking issues should be rejected.
