# @speckit/adapter-edu-us

Maps the curated Education (US) bundle (`.speckit/catalog/specs/compliance/edu-us/edu-us.yaml`) into the normalized `SpecModel`. Requirements are tagged with federal frameworks (FERPA, COPPA, CIPA, PPRA) and optional state overlays (California SOPIPA, New York Education Law 2-d) so downstream tooling can filter scopes and overlays.
